Automatically builds or removes blueprint / deconstruction / ghosts near the player. It has the same behaviour like you would do yourself mining or removing things. Also supports deconstruction which will mine mineable things to your inventory. Deconsturctions works on everything which is markable.

**Note: Not tested with Space Age**

Note: This is the upgraded version of [player-auto-build](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/player-auto-build) but it is faster, removed enemy and player movement check and also greater build distance. Without his mod I wouldn't ever start with it.

- Items are taken from the player inventory.
- Includes a key binding and shortcut to toggle. Default is Shift-C and the shortcut is always available for your quickbar.

# Known Bugs
- Auto-Deconstruction will sometimes try to remove even order is canceled. This happens while mod was going about to destroy but it did not work (like inventory was full, doing undo etc). Will be fixed in free time.
- **[FIXED]** Cliffs should only be removed if cliff explosives are in inventory (will be fixed soon)
- **[FIXED]** Concretes etc do not get removed. I didn't find the best way to remove them and will skip for next time.

# Todo
- More effeciency how bulding and deconstruction works to avoid bugs
